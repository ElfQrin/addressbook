Simple Database handling for PHP / *SQL (MySQL, MySQLi, PostgreSQL, SQLite) that can perform all basic operations: Create Database, Add Record, Edit Record, Delete Records, View all Records, Search the Database, Export the Database, Statistics, Empty the Database, Remove the Database.

Note that it's meant to provide the code to work with a database, not as a stand alone application. It doesn't handle users so that if you put it online as is, anybody will be able to add, edit, or delete entries (records). However it does support user permissions for all operations, so that it's not hard to make it work into an existing PHP website with user registration.
